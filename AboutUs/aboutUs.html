        <h1>Summary About Red-Tailed Hawk</h1> <br>
      
        <p>
          The Red-tailed Hawk, scientifically known as Buteo jamaicensis, is a magnificent bird of prey that holds the title of the most widespread and familiar large hawk in North America. This versatile raptor is characterized by its bulky and broad-winged physique, which is specifically designed for effortless soaring. The Red-tailed Hawk is an inhabitant of open country, commonly seen perched on roadside poles or sailing over fields and woods. Its trademark reddish-brown tail, which is a characteristic feature of adult individuals, sets it apart, although the rest of their plumage can be quite variable, especially west of the Mississippi. Western Red-tails can range from blackish to rufous-brown to nearly white. The species is a top predator, playing a vital role in local ecosystems by helping to control the populations of small mammals, including rodents and rabbits
          
          The Red-tailed Hawk is a great gateway species into birding or hawk watching. Among the large, soaring hawks known as buteos, Red-tails are the most widespread in North America. They often hunt along highways, circling overhead or hovering in place as they scan the ground for prey. They are formidable hunters, with sharp eyesight that's eight times better than a human's. In flight, they can spy a mouse on the ground from 100 feet in the air—about ten stories high. When a Red-tailed Hawk spots a rodent, rabbit, lizard, or other prey scurrying, it swoops down and grabs its meal in its talons—the big claws on its feet. Once the hawk grabs its prey, it usually flies back up to its perch to eat it. Red-tailed Hawks often mate for life and make a stick nest in a tree, high above the ground. The female hawk lays one to five eggs—which are white with brown spots
          
          The Red-tailed Hawk is the largest buteo in eastern North America and is one of the most commonly observed birds of prey in the region. Its habit of perching conspicuously in open farmland habitat has made it a frequent target for observation and study. The species has adapted to nesting in cities in several regions of North America and has apparently increased in some areas since the 1960s, with numbers now stable or still increasing. However, the species faces threats such as shootings, collisions with automobiles, and human activities near nests. Efforts to protect the Red-tailed Hawk are in place, as it is considered to be a sign of good luck and is protected under the U.S. Migratory Bird Act and CITES Appendix II
