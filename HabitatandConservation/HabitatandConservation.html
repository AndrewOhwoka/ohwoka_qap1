        <h2>Biology and Identification</h2>
        <p>
          The Red-tailed Hawk is a robust bird, with a wingspan that can reach
          up to <b>56</b> <i>inches</i> (<b>142</b> <i>cm</i>) and an average
          length of <b>18</b> to <b>26 </b> <i>inches </i>(<b>45</b> to
          <b>65</b> <i>cm</i>). It exhibits a notable size dimorphism, with
          females generally larger than males, a common trait among raptors. The
          bird's plumage varies considerably across its range and among its
          subspecies, from the classic brick-red tail and rich brown back of the
          nominate race to the lighter and sometimes almost whitish underparts
          of birds in western North America. Juveniles are recognized by their
          brown streaked underparts and lack of the red tail, which develops as
          they mature.
